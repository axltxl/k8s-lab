    This function changes the working directory to the project root, reads the

    Docker registry.

      - The registry host IP is retrieved from the "k8s_api_server_ip" key in the
        "config.yaml" file located in the project root.
      - The Docker image is tagged with the format:
        "<docker_registry_host>:5000/k8s-lab/todod".
